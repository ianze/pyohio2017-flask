            <h1>Intro</h1>
            <aside class="notes">
                As you might have seen in one of the key notes in Pycon this year, Python is very diverse in it's
                usages.<br/>

                Me and Brad in our current role are mostly using Python for long running ETL processes and data science,
                Earlier this year though we had an opportunity to develop a web application that will be used
                internally.<br/>

                We decided to use Python that we know and like in order to develop this application and wanted to share
                the experience with other developers that might not use Python for web development. Or developers that
                use
                other frameworks and want to get an idea of how it looks in Flask.

            <h4>Why Flask</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Micro framework</li>
                <li>Extensions</li>
                <li>Jinja2</li>
                <li>Team preference</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
                Python has some great web frameworks to choose some and each one has some unique advantages.
                As we knew we wanted to use Python for this project Flask was a great fit due to several reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Some members in the team had very basic familiarity with it</li>
                    <li>It is based on Jinja2 that we use in our other projects</li>
                    <li>It is a micro-framework and very easy to get up and running. Which also leads to a very fast
                        learning curve
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It has many extensions so for example you are not limited to a specific ORM, as we knew our DB
                        connection
                        challenges might be unique we wanted flexibility on that.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                These are reasons that led us to choose Flask but if you are looking into a new web dev project you
                should look at a few frameworks to see what fits you.

            <h4>Basic Application</h4>
            <section>
                        <pre><code data-trim data-noescape>
                            from flask import Flask
                            import json
                            import requests
                            import os

                            API_KEY = os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY']
                            CX_ID = os.environ['CX_ID']
                            app = Flask(__name__)
                        </code></pre>
                <aside class="notes">
                    One of the nice things about Flask is that you can start with a basic application
                    contained in one file and grow it from there<br/>
                    We will show a simple example like this with an application that queries PyPI
                    and grow it from there<br/>
                    Let us look at the code here.. At first we see the imports
                    including the Flask object.<br/>
                    We define some values we need for the functionality..<br/>
                    in order to query the API that are saved in the environment as you
                    should always do in order not to hard code sensitive data.<br/>
                    Using the Flask object we actually initialize our application object and using
                    the __name__ is the standard way to do it.<br/>
                </aside>
            </section>
            <section>
                         <pre><code data-trim data-noescape style="max-height:700px">
                             @app.route("/")
                             def search():
                                 search_url = \
                                    "https://www.googleapis.com/customsearch/v1"
                                 params = {'key': API_KEY, 'cx': CX_ID, 'q': 'flask'}
                                 r = requests.get(search_url, params=params)
                                 response = r.content.decode('utf-8')
                                 result = json.loads(response)

                                 return result['items'][1]['formattedUrl'], 200
                         </code></pre>
                <aside class="notes">
                    once we have an application object we can actually define our application for example
                    as here we are defining one route that is served on the root and using the route decorator
                    this is how we are telling flask we want this route to be handled by this logic.<br/>
                    You will see flask makes a lot of use with decorators.<br/><br/>

                    The actual logic is always query google API in order to find the results for "flask"
                    on the specific engine we defined that is searching in PyPI.<br/><br/>

                    We are returning the url of the result and setting return code of 200. We explicitly defined the 200
                    status code to demonstrate a return code but this is also the default code that is returned if no
                    code is specified.<br/><br/>

                    And this demonstrates how you write very simple kind of "Hello, world" app with Flask.
                    But yet still you can see it already has some functionality and it is also confined in one
                    file.<br/>

            <h2>WSGI</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>PEP-3333</h3>
                <aside class="notes">
                    Web Server Gateway Interface<br/>
                    If this is your first introduction to web development in Python
                    you probably will hear more and more about WSGI. This is why I feel this is something that is worth
                    taking the time to
                    understand. And even experienced web devs will have the ability to have a refresher.<br/><br/>

                    This is basically a PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal).<br/>
                    It is meant to define a specification for the communication that will happen between the server or
                    and the
                    web framework or application.<br/>
                    WSGI also supports adding a middleware application into your stack. The middleware can serve
                    different needs
                    for example doing some custom processing. While the middleware still stays agnostic to the server or
                    application.
                    This way your application can be used with different web servers with little to no changes and a
                    middleware you wrote
                    can be used by different applications.<br/>

                    Why this is great? Because there is standard way to build a web server and for it to interact with
                    the framework.
                    Then the framework (hopefully) providers a very simple API for us as the web developers to work with
                    and focus on the
                    application development/logic.<br/>s

                <h2>WSGI Server</h2>
                <aside class="notes">
                    For a production ready application you will need to choose a WSGI server to run your application.
                    There several options for a production ready WSGI server to choose from.
                    Two main ones we considered were: gUnicorn, uWSGI.<br/>

                    Gunicorn ‘Green Unicorn’ is a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX.
                    It’s a pre-fork worker model ported from Ruby’s Unicorn project.<br/>

                    uWSGI on the other hand is a much more broad project that aims at developing full stack for
                    building hosting services.
                    You can develop application server using a common API and common configuration style.<br/>
                    Thanks to its pluggable architecture it can be extended to support more platforms and
                    languages such as c, c++, ruby and Go.<br/>
                    The name uWSGI is confusing as it supports more than WSGI and it is because WSGI was the first
                    plugin developed to
                    support WSGI.<br/><br/>

                    For me the main consideration is ease of use as both of them are similar in performance,
                    and this is not the area you want to optimize anyway.<br/>
                    Both are pip installable and can be run in a similar way.<br/>
                    For our project we chose gUnicorn as it is a more light weight vs uWSGI can be more overwhelming at
                    first with
                    how much configuration flags can be used with it.<br/>
                    For project that might have more challenges not seen upfront or more complex, especially trying to
                    run multiple applications from one server would use uWSGI.<br/>

                <aside class="notes">
                    This is the most simple and basic way to run a flask app right now with
                    the flask WSGI server that comes when installing Flask and mainly used
                    for debugging purposes. This is very nice for local debugging but notice,
                    things to note here:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            If there are syntax errors in app.py file you won't get an error but
                            you will just get a cryptic message saying that app.py is not on the path.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is single process and can only serve one request at a time, if your
                            application is doing interesting things like calling itself etc (for example
                            in micro services architecture) then you will have to work around that.
                        </li>

                <aside class="notes">
                    As I mentioned we are using gUnicorn and this is the way you will run it in production.<br/>
                    The options on the command line are very simple as you see your application is listenning
                    on port 8080.
                    You have 4 worker processes that are serving requests coming to the application,
                    and the only argument supplied to the application is the module containing the
                    application object.

                    Once you have an application you are ready to deploy and run in production
                    you will need to package it.<br/><br/>

                    Both for applications that are for internal use and available on the internet
                    you might want to store them on local PyPI compliant server.<br/>
                    These are commands you would run and upload a new version of your application.<br/>
                    We are using Artifactory as it support PyPI repositories but there are many
                    others and the same commands will work with them as well.
                    The first command here is creating the wheel for the application and the second
                    command is uploading it to PyPI "like" repository.

                    What you would usually do is recreate your virtual environment and then
                    you will install it from your local PyPI repository. All you need to do is
                    make sure that you are pointing to your local PyPI repository you want to install
                    from.

                <aside class="notes">
                    One of the advantages of Flask is it does not impose much of a structure you have to follow
                    when building your application but that can also be a disadvantage when building
                    large complex application.<br/><br/>

                    cookie cutter is a great tool you can use in order to start your application
                    and we got some ideas from a few cookiecutter projects that were out there but also
                    customized it for our needs.<br/><br/>

                    Main files:<br/><br/>

                    readme.md - even when you have a small team working on the project it is a good idea
                    to have get into a habit of having a readme file that describes the project.
                    You can put there information about how the application is deployed and also
                    development.<br/><br/>

                    setup.py, MANIFEST.IN - Those are the files you need to define in order to deploy
                    your package. They provide the instructions on how to build the package.<br/><br/>

                    __init__.py, app.py - this is where we create the main application and
                    initializing all that is needed for the outside application logic like
                    define routes(blueprint), any extensions needed or hooks like for example
                    perform actions before and after every requests.<br/>
                    This is basically an extension of the one line we had before
                    where we initialized the application now in a larger application it becomes
                    more complex.<br/><br/>

                    config.py - we can define a separate config class for each application.
                    and have some logic in order to choose between them in there.<br/><br/>

                    forms.py - subclasses of the FalskForm so that we will have
                    automatic validation. As we didn't have many forms at first we kept it
                    as one module but can be extended to directory..<br/><br/>

                    Directories:<br/><br/>

                    templates - Jinja2 templates that render the pages of the application<br/><br/>

                    routes - define logic to process request and then call a service.<br/><br/>

                    services - classes that do actual logic of the application<br/><br/>

                    models - the ORM layer. We used SQLAlchemy but Flask does not enforce that.<br/>

                    jobs - backend jobs that are done using APScheduler in order to support<br/>
                    backend jobs.

                    Here is an example based off of the Flask application that Ian showed earlier.<br>
                    The route is registered using flask blueprints.<br>

                    The blueprints are registered when the application starts, and makes all of the routes
                    accessible.<br>

                    A Blueprint object works similarly to a Flask application object, but it is not actually an application.<br/>
                    Rather it is a blueprint of how to construct or extend an application.<br/>

                    The basic concept of blueprints is that they record operations to execute when registered on an application.<br/>
                    Flask associates view functions with blueprints when dispatching requests and generating URLs from one endpoint to another.<br/>

                    In this example we are not rendering a HTML template, but simply returning the content to the
                    screen.<br>

                    The return value of a route is typically what is referred to as a view.

                    achieved the right balance of abstraction and ease of use.

        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)

                    SQLAlchemy database models are a very simple and powerful way to express database objects as
                    classes.<br>
                    Additionally you can specify metadata about the object in the model definition.<br> For example
                    you can specify the database schema that the table lives in as well as the bind key so you can
                    interact
                    with multiple databases at the same time.<br>

                    In the application that Ian and I worked on we had the requirement to be able to connect to multiple
                    different database cluster at the same time.<br/>
                    For Example we might have a users tables in Production, Hot Stand-by, QA, and Development
                    Environments
                    and have the need to query all environments at the same time.

                    This SQLAlchemy query uses the user model that we defined in the previous slide and returns all the
                    rows
                    based on a case insensitive compare to the input user_name.<br/>
                    The syntax is very easy to use, but it can quickly become verbose as the complexity of your query
                    grows.

                    The joke between cash money and computer cache has been made numerous times, but in reality its not

                    Adding caching to your Flask application can save you time and money on development effort.

                    Hopefully some of you had a chance to attend the talk by Ernest Durbin about maintaining PYPI and
                    the impact caching had.

                    listed above.<br>
                    The documentation is very thorough and configuration was very simple.<br/>
                    Ian and I implemented the FileSystem Cache.<br/>
                    The Cache solution you choose to implement will be determined by your specific application needs.
                    <br/>
                    For example if your application sits behind a load balancer you will likely want to consider a cache
                    solution <br/>
                    that is distributed over a simple File System Cahce where the cache location is local to the
                    application.<br>

                    Make sure you understand what you are caching and determine if you need to include a way to
                    invalidate the cache.<br/>
                    Caching can lead to a better user experience, but it can also lead to scenarios that you are serving
                    stale data.

                    Here are some examples of the two ways you typically implement cache using one of the two
                    decorators.<br>
                    cached is most helpful when you need to cache a mostly static page.<br>
                    I will have a brief live demo of caching<br/>

                    memoize is used on methods that accept parameters and that way the cache is created based on the
                    input parameters to the method.<br>

                    The timeout is specified in seconds.<br>

                    <br>
                    Ian and I encountered several mostly static pages that were driven by a database query, and
                    implementing caching significantly improved the performance of the site.
                    In our case some of the data was updated night during some batch processing so we created a backend
                    job to pre-warm the cache and set the cache to expire in 24 hours
                    to eliminate the need for calls to the database.
